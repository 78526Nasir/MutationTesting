# What is Mutation Testing?

  Mutation Testing is a type of software testing where we mutate (change) certain statements in the source code and check if the test cases are able to find the errors. It is a type of white box testing which is mainly used for unit testing. The changes in mutant program are kept extremely small, so it does not affect the overall objective of the program.
